# Energy-Load-Forecasting-OpenSTEF-Study-Implementation
1. Summary:
This project is a self‑implemented study of short‑term electrical load forecasting, inspired by industry tools such as OpenSTEF. 
The goal was to understand how energy demand can be predicted using historical data and basic statistical models, while gaining hands‑on experience with data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

This project was built independently as a learning and portfolio exercise and does not claim authorship of OpenSTEF or related industry frameworks.

Accurate short‑term load forecasting is critical for:
- Grid reliability and safety
- Energy planning and efficiency
- Integration of renewable energy sources

As an electrical engineering student interested in safety‑critical systems and data‑driven decision‑making, this project helped bridge power systems concepts with practical data analysis.

Given historical electrical load data, can we predict short‑term future demand (hours to days ahead) using simple, interpretable models?

2. Pipeline documents:
Loaded and merged multi-file ISO-NE hourly load data
Constructed datetime from Date + HourEnding
Performed time-series sorting and validation
Analyzed peak demand and daily averages
Visualized system load trends using MATLAB
